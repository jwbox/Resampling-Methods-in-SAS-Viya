# How I create images and animated GIFs
I do all of the following from an iPad.  In some cases I use Keynote on a Mac to edit the contents.

## Images
* Create charts, drawings, illustrations in Keynote
* Export slides to images
* Use iOS shortcut to resize images

## Animated GIFs
* Create charts, drawings, illustrations in Keynote
* Export slides to images and select "include builds".  It will create separate images for each step of the slides animation sequence.
* Use iOS shortcut to resize the images
* Use iOS shortcut to build an animated GIF with selected speed and looping
* Notes:
	* I resize then build the animated GIF.  You can build the GIF and then resize but I have found that if it the file is too large it fails.  There are also cases where the GIF may resize correctly but the looping information is lost in the resulting file.
	* When resizing too many files at once the process may fail due to size.  I get around this by doing 50 files at the time.  You could edit the shortcut to save after processing each image to get around this.

## Grab the iOS Shortcuts:
Feel free to use the iOS shortcuts I mention above on your project.  

* [Batch Resize](./iOS%20shortcuts/Batch%20Resize.shortcut)
* [GIF Builder](./iOS%20shortcuts/GIF%20Builder.shortcut)
